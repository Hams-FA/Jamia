# Jamia

In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of people using Jamias as a way to manage their money. A  Jamia is a group that will put in a regular amount of money each month, then there will be turns on who will take the money each month. While this can be a convenient way to handle finances, there are some inherent problems with this system. One of the biggest issues is that since Jamias are not regulated by any financial institution, there is always the risk that someone could steal from the group.  Another problem is that people may not always be able to pay their share on time. 


“Jamia” aims to make it easier for people to join a Jamia, as it provides a more useful way to use the money each month, helping with that by keeping track of payments and balances. By managing money in a coordinated way, Jamia can help to improve the overall well-being of its members. Overall, Jamia is a great way to manage finances and can be very helpful for people who are trying to save money.
